13. Devices designed with lambda design rules are prone to shorts and opens.
a) true
b) false
Answers: b
Explanation: Lambda design rules prevents shorting, opens, contact from slipping out of area to be contacted.

1. Diffusion and polysilicon layers are connected together using
a) butting contact
b) buried contact
c) separate contact
d) cannot be connected
View Answer
Answer: a
Explanation: Diffusion and polysilicon layer are joined together using butting contact. In butting contact the two layers are joined or binded together.

2. Which is more complex process?
a) buried contact
b) butting contact
c) buried & butting contact
d) none of the mentioned
View Answer
Answer: a
Explanation: Butting contact is complex process whereas buried contact is simple process because butting contact should be done more carefully to serve well and be strong.

3. Which contact cut occupies smaller area?
a) buried contact
b) butting contact
c) buried & butting contact
d) none of the mentioned
View Answer
Answer: a
Explanation: Buried contact occupies smaller area than butting contact as in buried contacts one layer will be completely within or almost within the another layer.

4. Isolation layer between two metal layers must be thinner.
a) true
b) false
View Answer
Answer: b
Explanation: Isolation layer between two metal layers should be thicker. Metal to metal separation is large and is brought about mainly by difficulties in defining metal edges accurately.

5. The oxide layer below the first metal layer is deposited using
a) diffusion method
b) chemical vapour deposition
c) solid deposition
d) scattering method
View Answer
Answer: b
Explanation: The oxide layer below the first metal layer is depostied using chemical vapour deposition method. This is a chemical process used to produce high quality high performance solid materials.

6. Which layer is used for power and signal lines?
a) metal
b) polysiicon
c) n-diffusion
d) p-diffusion
View Answer
Answer: a
Explanation: Metal layers are used for power and signal lines as metals has good thermal and electrical conductivity.

7. Minimum feature size for thick oxide is
a) 2λ
b) 3λ
c) 4λ
d) λ
View Answer
Answer: b
Explanation: The minimum feature size for thick oxide is 3λ and minimum separation between thinox regions is also 3λ.
