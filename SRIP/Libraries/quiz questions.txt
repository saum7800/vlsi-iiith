a) buried contacts
b) butted contacts
c) butted & buried contacts
d) none of the mentioned
Answer: a
an: Buried contacts are much better than butted contacts. In butted contacts the two layers are joined together or binded together using adhesive type of material where as in buried contact one layer is interconcted or fitted into another.

a) lambda rules
b) micron rules
c) layer rule
d) source rule
Answer: b
an: Micron rules occupies or consumes lesser area. 50% of the area usage can be reduced by using micron rules over lambda rules.

a) true
b) false
c) kuch to
d) kuch bhi
Answers: b
an: Lambda design rules prevents shorting, opens, contact from slipping out of area to be contacted.

1. Diffusion and polysilicon layers are connected together using
a) butting contact
b) buried contact
c) separate contact
d) cannot be connected
Answer: a
an: Diffusion and polysilicon layer are joined together using butting contact. In butting contact the two layers are joined or binded together.

2. Which is more complex process?
a) buried contact
b) butting contact
c) buried & butting contact
d) none of the mentioned
Answer: a
an: Butting contact is complex process whereas buried contact is simple process because butting contact should be done more carefully to serve well and be strong.

3. Which contact cut occupies smaller area?
a) buried contact
b) butting contact
c) buried & butting contact
d) none of the mentioned 
Answer: a
an: Buried contact occupies smaller area than butting contact as in buried contacts one layer will be completely within or almost within the another layer.

4. Isolation layer between two metal layers must be thinner.
a) true
b) false
c) kuch to
d) kuch bhi 
Answer: b
an: Isolation layer between two metal layers should be thicker. Metal to metal separation is large and is brought about mainly by difficulties in defining metal edges accurately.

5. The oxide layer below the first metal layer is deposited using
a) diffusion method
b) chemical vapour deposition
c) solid deposition
d) scattering method
Answer: b
an: The oxide layer below the first metal layer is depostied using chemical vapour deposition method. This is a chemical process used to produce high quality high performance solid materials.

6. Which layer is used for power and signal lines?
a) metal
b) polysiicon
c) n-diffusion
d) p-diffusion
Answer: a
an: Metal layers are used for power and signal lines as metals has good thermal and electrical conductivity.

7. Minimum feature size for thick oxide is
a) 2λ
b) 3λ
c) 4λ
d) λ
Answer: b
an: The minimum feature size for thick oxide is 3λ and minimum separation between thinox regions is also 3λ.

8. Hatching is compatible with
a) monochrome encoding
b) bicode encoding
c) tricode encoding
d) not compatible with any encoding
Answer: a
an: Hatching is compatible with monochrome encoding and also may be added to color mask coding. It is designed using closely spaced lines or sticks.

9. Minimum n-well width should be ____ micro meter
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 6
Answer: b
an: The minimum width of n-well is 3 micro meter because n-well should be with little thickness and in it p-type devices are formed.

10. The minimum spacing between two n-well is _____ micro meter
a) 4
b) 5
c) 8
d) 8.5
Answer: d
an: The minimum spacing between two n-well is 8.5 micro meter according to the lambda based design rules.

11. Which can bring about variations in threshold voltage?
a) oxide thickness
b) ion implantation
c) poly variations
d) all of the mentioned
Answer: d
an: One of the problem in the manufacture using design rule is that variation in threshold voltage occurs. And this is caused by oxide thickness, ion implantation and poly variations.
