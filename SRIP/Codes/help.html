            On the simulator page, there are 10 buttons.<br> 8 of the 10 buttons are for the various components that may be used.<br>
The components used are Metal-1, Active, Contact, Poly, N-well, N-select, P-select and via.<br>
The 2 remaining buttons are "clear all" and "check DRC".
        </p>
        <h3>Procedure for use</h3>
        <ol id="ol">
            <li> Click on the button for any of the components. You will see that component appear on the canvas to the right of the buttons.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Click on the component that just appeared. You will see 8 small squares on the component.<br> 4 on the corners and 4 at the middle points of the sides of the rectangle.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Press and drag the corner squares to resize the component without changing the aspect ratio of the component.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Press and drag the mid-point squares to resize the component by changing height or width only in direction of dragging.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Press and drag anywhere else on the component to change it's position on the canvas.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Click on the button of any component. New component will appear on the canvas and you may manipulate it's position and size<br> in the same way as shown in steps 3,4 and 5.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Make the layout design using the components.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Click on the " Check DRC " button to check if the layout made satisfies the design layout rules correctly.</li>
            <br>
            <li> You will get an alert which will tell you if DRC rules are satisfied or not.</li>
            <br>
            <li> If DRC rules are not satisfied, you will also get an alert to tell you which specific DRC rule has been violated.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Click the " clear all " button to start making and testing a new layout.</li>
        </ol>
